			<h2>What our clients say</h2>

				During my private flights, my Flight Manager Valerie was there 
				to assist me with any of my questions or concerns. Since then, 
				I have been flying Hyer on a frequent basis. I cannot wait for

			<h2>Our timeline</h2>
			<h3>2021</h3>
			<p>
				The company expanded its services to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 
				Clients outside the initial closed group were welcomed to book with ENVOY. 
				The company introduced the innovative Smart Quotes, simplifying the process
				of choosing an aircraft. Shortly after, the client base expanded to the 
				United Kingdom and Spain.
			</p>
			<h3>2022</h3>
			<p>
				First-of-its-kind Shared Flights were introduced. Repatriation flights were
				organised in Asia, Africa and Europe with both small and large aircraft. 
				Special solutions for groups and a carbon offset program for private 
				aviation in Benelux were launched. 
			</p>
			<h3>2023</h3>
			<p>
				ENVOY rebranded to Hyer® Aviation. A new brand, website and a tech-driven 
				strategy were launched, followed by a bold service portfolio. An innovative 
				proprietary platform and an ambitious membership program were released to 
				support better the rapid demand for Hyer® services and exclusive flights.
			</p>
			<h3>2024</h3>
			<p>
				Hyer developed a client portfolio and launched an exclusive mobile application
				for its loyal clients. A significant increase in demand, primarily during summer, 
				has led to additional sales teams and flight support.
